##
## Description:
## List all Inspector findings in a region and generate finding details.
## 
## Resolution:
## Read the finding description and recommendation to resolve.
##
## NOTES:
## In order for this custom signature to execute, you must attach a policy that permits
## Inspector List* and Describe* API calls, to the IAM Role for Evident.io. Not doing so
## will result in methods not being available due to the 'inspector' client being missing
## in the inherited AWS class.
##
## The "AmazonInspectorReadOnlyAccess" AWS-managed policy provides sufficient privelege
## for this custom signature to execute. arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonInspectorReadOnlyAccess
